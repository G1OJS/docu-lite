## ðŸ›  Installation

Install using pip: open a command window and type

```
pip install docu-lite
```
## Usage
Either edit and run docu-lite.py in an IDE, or run from the command line:
```
docu-lite [-i INPUT_PATTERN] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [-s CSS_FILE] [--documentation]
```
Arguments:

-i specifies the input file pattern, e.g. /folder/folder/*.py

-o specifies the name for the output file e.g. /folder/folder/outline.html

-s specifies the name of the css file you want to use

--documentation produces less detailed output differently styled for use as, or editing to produce, documentation.
This mode uses a completely separate style sheet so can be tailored independently. Run docu-lite twice with and
without this option to produce two sets of output for different purposes.

*if you specify a css file, all docu-lite does is ensure that the output html references that file instead of the default

*if the default css file is missing, it will be generated and used
